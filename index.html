            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>On <strong>11 March 2011</strong>, at <strong>14:46:24 JST</strong> (05:46:24 UTC), a magnitude <strong>9.0–9.1</strong> undersea megathrust earthquake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, 72 km (45 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of the Tōhoku region. It lasted approximately <strong>six minutes</strong> and caused a devastating tsunami.</p>
            <p>It is sometimes known in Japan as the <strong>"Great East Japan Earthquake"</strong> (東日本大震災, Higashi Nihon Daishinsai). The disaster is often referred to by its numerical date, <strong>3.11</strong>.</p>
            <p>This was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.</p>

            <h2>The Earthquake</h2>
            <h3>Key Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> 9.0–9.1 Mw (momentmagnitude scale)</li>
                <li><strong>Depth:</strong> 32 km (20 mi) below the ocean floor</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Approximately 6 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> 38.297°N 142.372°E, 72 km off Oshika Peninsula</li>
                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Megathrust earthquake (subduction zone)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cause</h3>
            <p>The earthquake was caused by a thrust fault related to subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Okhotsk Plate. This type of megathrust earthquake occurs when the subducting plate ruptures suddenly, releasing enormous amounts of energy stored over centuries.</p>
            <h3>Intensity</h3>
            <p>The earthquake was felt strongly across the entire island of Honshu. Seismic recordings detected the earthquake worldwide, with magnitude estimates varying between 8.9 and 9.1.</p>

        <section id="tsunami">
            <h2>The Tsunami</h2>
            <h3>Wave Heights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximum recorded:</strong> 40.5 meters (133 feet) in Miyako</li>
                <li><strong>Traveled:</strong> Across the Pacific Ocean reaching coasts worldwide</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Approximately 800 km/h (500 mph) in open ocean</li>
                <li><strong>Time to reach Tokyo:</strong> Approximately 3 hours</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Damage</h3>
            <p>The tsunami destroyed coastal cities and villages, sweeping away houses, trees, and infrastructure. The waves inundated up to 10 kilometers inland in some areas. Major ports were damaged, and the disaster sparked a major nuclear emergency at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
            <h3>Wave Characteristics</h3>
            <p>Unlike typical tsunamis preceded by a receding ocean, eyewitnesses reported the first wave appeared as a large wall of water that came ashore with tremendous force. Multiple waves followed, each destructive in its own right.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath & Casualties</h2>
            <h3>Death Toll</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confirmed deaths:</strong> 15,894</li>
                <li><strong>Missing persons:</strong> 2,562</li>
                <li><strong>Injured:</strong> 27,110</li>
                <li><strong>Total affected:</strong> Over 127,000 people displaced</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
            <p>The disaster caused approximately <strong>$210–235 billion USD</strong> in damages, making it the costliest natural disaster in history at that time. Entire prefectures were devastated, with reconstruction efforts lasting years.</p>
            <h3>Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster</h3>
            <p>The tsunami disabled cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to meltdowns in three reactors. This became the second-worst nuclear accident in history, after Chernobyl. The disaster led to major changes in nuclear safety protocols worldwide.</p>

        <section id="environmental">
            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <h3>Coastal Erosion & Landscape Changes</h3>
            <p>The tsunami dramatically reshaped Japan's coastline. Beaches were eroded, sand dunes were destroyed, and rocky formations were altered. Some areas experienced subsidence (sinking) of up to 1.2 meters, permanently changing the topography and increasing vulnerability to future flooding.</p>
            <h3>Soil Contamination</h3>
            <p>Saltwater from the tsunami contaminated agricultural soil with salt and sediment. Fishing grounds and rice paddies became unusable for years. The salt infiltration required extensive remediation efforts and crop rotation programs. Some agricultural lands were permanently damaged and repurposed.</p>
            <h3>Marine Ecosystem Damage</h3>
            <p>Fish populations were disrupted by the tsunami and changes to water temperature. Coral reefs and marine habitats were damaged. The underwater environment took years to recover as ecosystems rebalanced. Commercial fishing industries were severely impacted as fish stocks needed time to replenish.</p>
            <h3>Water Pollution & Debris</h3>
            <p>The tsunami mixed saltwater with freshwater systems, contaminating drinking water sources. Industrial chemicals, oil, and hazardous materials from destroyed factories and ships spread across coastal waters. Massive amounts of debris—wood, plastics, and other materials—floated across the Pacific, affecting marine life worldwide.</p>
            <h3>Forest Damage</h3>
            <p>Coastal forests were flattened or damaged by the tsunami. Trees were uprooted, leaving barren landscapes that required decades for natural regeneration. Some forests were replanted as part of reconstruction efforts, creating opportunities to study forest recovery and resilience.</p>
            <h3>Radiation Contamination</h3>
            <p>The Fukushima nuclear disaster released radioactive materials into the air and ocean. Agricultural products from the region became contaminated, affecting food safety nationwide. The radiation spread to marine environments, impacting fish and seaweed industries. Environmental monitoring and decontamination efforts continue years after the disaster.</p>
            <h3>Groundwater & River Systems</h3>
            <p>Saltwater intrusion affected groundwater systems near the coast, making wells unsuitable for drinking or irrigation. Rivers were damaged and sediment patterns changed. Water management infrastructure required major reconstruction to restore reliable freshwater supplies.</p>
            <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
            <p>Habitats for endangered species were destroyed. Some species lost critical breeding grounds and food sources. Long-term biodiversity recovery programs were established to help restore ecosystems and protect species threatened by the disaster.</p>

            <h2>Global Impact & Legacy</h2>
            <h3>International Response</h3>
            <p>Countries worldwide sent aid and rescue teams to Japan. The disaster drew international attention to earthquake and tsunami preparedness, leading to improvements in early warning systems across the Pacific.</p>
            <h3>Scientific Understanding</h3>
            <p>The earthquake provided valuable data for seismologists studying megathrust earthquakes and subduction zones. It led to revisions in earthquake risk assessments and building code standards globally.</p>
            <h3>Long-term Recovery</h3>
            <p>Japan's reconstruction efforts showcased resilience and modern engineering. New tsunami walls and better early warning systems were implemented. Many areas have been rebuilt with improved disaster preparedness measures.</p>
            <h3>Memorial & Remembrance</h3>
            <p>March 11 is now observed in Japan as a day of remembrance. Numerous memorials, museums, and monuments have been erected to honor the victims and ensure the lessons learned are not forgotten.</p>
